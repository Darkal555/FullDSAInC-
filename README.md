📚 FullDSAInC++
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This project is a collection of my learning and implementation of core DSA topics in C++, organized topic-wise for easy navigation and understanding. The goal is to deepen my knowledge of algorithmic problem solving and serve as a reference for myself and others preparing for coding interviews or improving their problem-solving skills.

🚀 Repository Structure
The repository is divided into multiple directories, each focusing on a specific concept:

Array – Common array problems and their C++ implementations.

String – Manipulation and pattern-matching problems.

Recursion – Recursive solutions to problems like palindrome check, factorial, merge sort, etc.

Linked List – Operations on singly and doubly linked lists.

Stack / Queue / Pointer / OOP’s – Core programming concepts and implementations.

Tree – Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree creation, traversals, and modifications.
Graph – Algorithms like DFS, BFS, Topological Sort, Cycle Detection, and real-world graph problems.
Sorting – Merge sort and other classic algorithms.
Mathematics – Number theory and other mathematical algorithms.
STL – A mini cheat sheet and uses of Standard Template Library in C++.
Each folder contains .cpp files with source code and .exe files for compiled binaries (for testing).

🛠 Languages & Tools
Language Used: C++ (98.5%), Python (1.2%)
